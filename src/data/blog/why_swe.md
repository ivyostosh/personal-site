# Intro
I often wish I could be be more brave to pursue what I call my passion, so this transition journey can be shorter. However, it's time truly helps me see, through ups and downs, Software Engineering is the path I never give up on. 

# How long did it take me?
\
I consider college life as the start of adulthood. With that start point, it took me ten years to be certain - yes, I want to become a full-time Software Engineer. \
\
By the time I went to college, I was old enough to know it's important to pick a major that secures a job. Accounting just seems to be a perfect fit for a girl, as many still believes today. Classes and internship were easy for me. Accounting as a subject itself is logical, and I was good at recognizing patterns and applying them. However, I had many doubts at myself in that career - I'm not sensitive to numbers, which is a key quality of any good accountant. One million impact on the income statement is not much different from ten thousand in my eyes. The only difference to me is that the latter lacks one 0 from the other. I trained myself to know the former is more important, but I often became more interested in building the business models than researching the business implications behind them. At that time, technology was just something cool to me that can help automate procedures. \
\
I came to the U.S. to get a master’s degree in accounting from University of Virginia. School was not as exciting as what I imagined, but I had a clear mission: finishing my CPA exams and finding a job before my graduation. Then I took a class that almost screwed up that plan for me. The class was called IT in Finance, with core curriculum to design an automated hedge fund trading system to compete against over 20+ teams in a tournament. That class truly intrigued me. I couldn't help going back to the computer lab every night to test my program. I remember how mad I was at myself. I was proud of being a goal-oriented person, while one month away from taking my CPA exam, I kept taking detours to the computer labs which had no relevance to my exam. It was also not my competitiveness that kept me going. I knew our team’s algorithm wasn't as great as other teams’, and never counted on winning the tournament (though we did magically win the tournament of that year, which is a story for another day). This is when I started to realize how much I like programming. I had thoughts about switching majors but decided that would be a crazy idea after all the efforts I put into my accounting career. I also didn't grow up in a wealthy family, so asking my family for more money to get another education was not something acceptable to me.\
\
I started to work at a CPA firm after my graduation, but I kept on doing more explorations in the programming area. I started with taking some online coding courses offered by Coursera and Udacity. Then I went to a community college near me to take Data Structure (a core class in Computer Science). I had so much fun and encouragement from taking that class, so I applied for the online Master of Science in Computer Science program at Georgia Tech afterwards, regardless of many doubts I have of myself. Luckily, I got in. Many things happened in my life throughout my journey at Georgia Tech. I moved from the east coast to west coast, went through a heartbreaking breakup, switched jobs, met my husband and started a family. There were many times I felt overwhelmed and doubted if I would ever finish my Computer Science degree, but the goal I set for myself since the program start helped pull me through.\
\
*You only need to finish one class per semester, but don't stop until you graduate.*\
\
And I did it. I started my master’s degree in the fall of 2018, did ten consecutive semester of one class per semester, until I graduated in December 2021.\
\
It didn't become clear to me a full-time Software engineering job is what I want to do for life until the very end of my master's program.

# How do I know?
\
I always wish there was a moment that I would realize yes this is it, this is exactly what I want to be for life, but it never happened like that. It was time truly helped me see perspectives. I knew I would like to be come a full-time Software Engineer when I looked back in my adult years, and realized most of the happy or proud moments of myself were all related to that domain.\
\
In college, it was the time when I was on my computer trying to automate a business competition with excel formulas and macros disregard all the business analysis that should be taken in place. In my first graduate school, it was the time when I was worried about my CPA exams but couldn't help going back to computer lab to tune my hedge fund tournaments. In my second graduate school, it was the time when I was done with classes, but emailed the TA about something wrong about the old project. At work, it was the time when I built a Python program myself to automate a process people don't even care about.\
