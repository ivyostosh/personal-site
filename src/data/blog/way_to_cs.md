# Intro

This is a question I\'ve asked myself many times over the years. I haven\'t found an answer I\'m fully content with till this day.
So I will take a similar approach of how we approximate ILP solution using LP. I will try my best to articulate all the reasons I can think of.
Hopefully the day where P=NP comes soon, and everything will just naturally make sense.    

# Why do I want to be a Software Engineer?

Let's just get right to the point. \
\
I want to be a Software Engineer because making sense of complicated system intrigues me.
\
I want to be a Software Engineer because I believe in the power of incremental changes. 



# How long did it take?

I consider college life as the start of adulthood. With that start point, it took me ten years to confirm this answer - yes, I want to become a Software Engineer. \
\
In my teenage years, I wanted to be a writer and guitarist. I didn't stick to either of them as you can tell. I was not good at either, or had the courage to seriously consider them as careers. (Although I still believe I will go back to them one day :) ) \
\
By the time I went to college, I was old enough to know it's important to pick a major that secures a job. Accounting just seems be a perfect fit for a girl, as many still believes today. Classes and internship were easy for me. Accounting as a subject itself, is very logical. You just have to be patient enough to recognize the patterns, and everything else comes naturally. I often got praises from teachers and colleges about how good I am at accounting. Regardless, I still get confused often - I'm not sensitive to numbers, which is a key feature a qualified accountant should have. One million impact on the income statement is not much different from ten thousands in my eyes. The only difference to me is that the latter lacks one 0 from the other. I trained myself to know that former is more important, but I often become more interested in the relationship between all numbers, rather than the business implications behind them. At that time, technology was just something cool to me. I would exploit Excel functions and macros to automate procedures, nothing more fancy that than. That was obviously not enough signs for me to give up an education that I'm almost at the finish line.\
\
I came to the US to get a masters degree in Accounting. School was not as exciting as what I imagined to be, but I had a clear mission. I wanted to finish my CPA exam and find a job before I graduate. Luckily, I was able to achieve both. I took a class at UVA that really intrigued me. 

# When do I know?

I don't think it was one single moment that made me realize it. Looking back, there were moments that I felt like I should view as signs that indicate what I truly want to do.\

There was one thing happened that I could see as a turning point for me. I took a class called IT in Finance, where you need to design an automated hedge fund trading system to win a competition. That was so interesting to me. I was one month away from taking a CPA exam, but couldn't help go back to the computer lab to test my program again and again. I was pissed at myself back then. I see myself as a goal oriented person, but that was not the smart thing to do. Designing a great algorithm wouldn't help me get a job, but I just cannot get over the excitement being the commander chief of my hedge fund algorithm. Moreover, I even knew my algorithm wasn't that great, and had a really low chance of winning. I had all those negative feelings but kept on tuning my algorithm until the day of the tournament.\
\
 We were 15 minutes into the game, and I was really nervous of what was going to happen next. My algorithm usually does well at the beginning, but the performance tends to decay over time. Then, something magic happened. It was a hot summer night, and the rain timed it so well with our tournament, with huge thunderstorms. Our computer lab lost power, 15 minutes into the game. We were so lost of what happened and what would happen next, then Professor Grazioli came in and told us the tournament was over and we could go home. 
\
In college, it was the time when I was on my computer trying to automate a business competition with excel formulas disregard all the business analysis that should be taken in place.\
\
In graduate school, it was the time when I was struggling to finish both core accounting classes and CPA exams, but spent way more than usual time in the computer lab to make sense of a stock trading algorithm.\
\
At work, when I looked back of the first year of my achievement, and realized the only thing that made me proud of myself is building a Python program myself to automate a process people don't even care about.\
\
I always wish there was a moment that I would realize yes this is it, this is exactly what I want to be for life. But it never happened like that.\
\
You need to be able to recognize what you can be good at and what you love doing, and separate them.

# Lessons Learned

You don't necessarily have to do what you are truly passionate about at work. A sad truth is, most adults are not able to find a job in that nature. Even if you are truly passionate about something, and would give up everything else for it. Remember a job is a job. It is a means for people to earn money in exchange of their work. And that work is often not as glorious as what you think. \
\
Do consider what does that mean to you financially. I didn't grow up in a wealthy family, so staying financially stable was always an important goal I have. This is why I sticked to my full time accounting job even after I became clear what I have decided to do instead. I often blame myself for not being willing to give up work and just finishing my CS degree as fast as I can. But there are often times I feel really grateful of the long waiting journey I've been through. It took me a little over three years, ten semesters to finish my degree. I thought I would be so excited to be at the finish line, and be so proud of myself. Then I got overwhelmed by the anxiety of preparing for job interviews and finding a new job. \
\
If you are truly passionate about something, and are willing to give up everything else for it. I will say do it, but please keep in mind how hard this journey will be. I hold a believe that the true inventions comes from passion. I have a risk averse side that is stopping me from making bigger achievement. What does that mean for you if it doesn't work out? Are you ok with handling the mess at that point? \
