# Intro

I originally wanted to answer the question "Why do I want to be a Software Engineer" first, but I believe this is a more fundamental question that I should start with. \
\

# How long did it take?

Growing up I have always been the kid that questions a lot. I question the meaning of life, the meaning of working hard, and the meaning of being successful. I can't even say I have found the answer for all those questions till this day. What I could answer, is what makes me happy everyday.\
\
I didn't really have a keen interest in Computer Science until college. My major was accounting back in college. I didn't even pick that as my major. It was determined when I got admitted to school.  I like pattern recognition. I can be good with school, but I'm not sensitive to numbers. One million impact on the income statement is not much different from ten thousands. The only difference to me is that one lacks one 0 from the other.

# When do I know?

I don't think it was one single moment that made me realize it. Looking back, there were moments that I felt like I should view as queue of what I really want to do.\
\
In college, it was the time when I was on my computer trying to automate a business competition with excel formulas disregard all the business analysis that should be taken in place.\
\
In graduate school, it was the time when I was struggling to finish both core accounting classes and CPA exams, but spent way more than usual time in the computer lab to make sense of a stock trading algorithm.\
\
At work, when I looked back of the first year of my achievement, and realized the only thing that made me proud of myself is building a Python program myself to automate a process people don't even care about.\
\
I always wish there was a moment that I would realize yes this is it, this is exactly what I want to be for life. But it never happened like that.\

You need to be able to recognize what you can be good at and what you love doing, and separate them.
