# A reliable friend

Communication has never been easier. You don't need to worry about reading between the lines, implications from non-verbal languages, if your partner has a bad day or not. All things you need to be stressed about in the real world are not problems in the computer world.\

There is one straightforward way to communicate here. You tell the computer what you want to do, simply in 1s and 0s. It will tell you if it understands you in the most direct way. From there, you can make as many changes as you want until you fully achieve what you have envisioned. It has an extremely good memory. You can pick up a conversation where you left off from couple years back, and it will still remember the protocols you guys agreed upon. It will not turn its back on you. It doesn't have its own interest to decide if one thing should be done one way or the other. It executes as what you demand.
