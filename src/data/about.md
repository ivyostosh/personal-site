# Intro

I was a bit slow to find out what I truly want to do for life. 25 years to be exact.
By that time, I have finished both my undergraduate and graduate education in Accounting,
got my CPA license, and started to work at a CPA firm.
Regardless, I made up my mind to pursue a career in Computer Science instead.\
\
I was also a bit slow to act after making that decision.
After all, besides dream, there's life and life always comes with a cost.
So I kept my full-time Accounting job while continued on my transition.
It took me 3 years to finish my CS degree, build up a new resume,
and start to apply for a full-time Software Engineer position.\
\
Looking back, do I doubt myself and question my decisions?
Sometimes, but that never stopped me and would never stop me.
I believe in incremental changes, hard work, and doing things that you are truly passionate about.
I don't have the sharpest CS skills you can find on the market,
but I have the dedication, passion, and confidence to build a good piece of software.

# Currently

I currently work at Google as a Revenue Systems Analyst.
My main work is to develop revenue infrastructure work for Google Ads incentives programs.
I mainly use Google SQL, Plx Workflow, and Blaze BUILD for my work, but also find opportunities to do more work in Python, Pandas, Java and ML.
