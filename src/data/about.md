# Intro

I was a bit slow to find out what I truly want to do for life. 25 years to be exact.\
\
By that time, I have finished both my undergraduate and graduate education in Accounting,
got my CPA license, and started to work at a CPA firm.
Regardless, I made up my mind to pursue a career in Data Engineering instead.
Why? I came to realize nothing else in my career beats the excitement of building a good piece of software,
solving a hard problem, and optimizing a lengthy process.\
\
After making that decision, I took three years to finish my Computer Science degree, sharpen skills through side projects, and build a new resume.
I'm now ready to embark on a new journey as a full-time Data Engineer.

# Currently

I currently work at Google as a Data Analyst.
My main work is to build revenue infrastructure work for Google Ads incentives programs.
